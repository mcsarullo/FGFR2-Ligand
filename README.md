This is a repo investigating key substructures within candidate FGFR2 ligands sourced from ChEMBL. My current approach is leveraging a Graph Attention Neural Network (GAT) to represent ligands as graphs, recently now incorporporating stereochemistry into my graphical representations. Using PyTorch for implementing the GAT. 

Still a work in progress. Existing in this repo is another directory including older attempts at this project.
